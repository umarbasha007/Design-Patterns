## KISS Principle

- KISS, an acronym for **keep it simple, stupid**, is a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960. 
- The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson.
- The term "KISS principle" was in popular use by 1970. 
  
- Variations on the phrase include: 
  ```
  
  - "Keep it simple, silly", 
  - "keep it short and simple", 
  - "keep it simple and straightforward",
  - "keep it small and simple", 
  - "keep it simple, soldier",
  - "keep it simple, sailor".
