## S - Single-responsibility principle

> A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.


- The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every class in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, which it should encapsulate. All of that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.
- Robert C. Martin, the originator of the term, expresses the principle as, "A class should have only one reason to change," although, because of confusion around the word "reason" he more recently stated "This principle is about people."
